# Hi, I'm Andrea 👋👨🏻‍💻

I'm Andrea, Mobile Engineering Manager in [Neato Robotics](https://neatorobotics.com). 

## What I like to do?

- 💻 I'm a code contributor on iOS projects. I love to explore new technologies, and I constantly improve the quality of products I work on by fixing bugs and refactoring the code base where necessary. I try to stay informed on new mobile technologies and test the promising ones to ensure I don't miss out on game-changing opportunities to boost productivity and quality of work.
- 🎾 I like to play beach tennis every season!
- 📖 I also started to report some technical adventures on Medium.
